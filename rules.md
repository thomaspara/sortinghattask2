Rules
Probably a duplicate if:
	a. the entries are the same but capitalization is different (e.g. "entry String", "Entry String", "entry string")
	b. one entry is a misspelling of another (e.g. "entry sstring", "entry string")
	c. the entry is a number which ought to be a whole number but is formatted like a float (e.g. Attribute = "Extension "| "123", "123.0")
	d. the entry is equivelent to another but different formatting (e.g Attribute  = "Phone Number" | "111-222-3333", "(111) 222-333", "1112223333")
	e. the entry is an abbreviation of another (e.g. "UK", "United Kingdom")
    f. the entry is a custom null symbol (e.g. #NULL!)
